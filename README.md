# FishyFishing

#### Description:
My final project for CS50x is a tiny game called FishyFishing which, you guessed it, is about fishing.
You are at a lake with two fishing spots and control a player which can go to those fishing spots. 

Don't look at the visual aspect too much. Didn't spend a lot of time on it :D

The game has three "phases". The first one is when you're not fishing and walking around the lake.

The second one is fishing phase, which starts when you've arrived at a fishing spot and pressed "E" on your keyboard.
During fishing phase, you will see ten fish which are same in color and speed and eleventh fish which has different color and is faster - that's our target!
You control a hook, which you can move around and you have to collide that hook with the target fish. When you do, the third, Catching phase starts.

During the final, Catching phase, two bars appear, the bar on the right side shows your progress of catching the fish. It is half-full and starts depleting immediately
The bar on the left is the catching bar, where you will see a fish icon and a rectangle. The fish moves up and down randomly, often changing direction.
The rectangle is under your control. by pressing W and S or UpArrow and DownArrow you can control the rectangle and your objective is to make sure that the fish is inside the rectangle.
When it is, the progress bar starts rising, when it isn't it starts depleting. And you've guessed it, when the progress bar reaches the bottom, it means that the fish escaped.
But when it reaches the top, it means you've caught the fish and the Caught Fish counter goes up! 

Either way, after the catching phase, whether the fish escaped or you caught it, you return to the lake as a player and have the freedom to either fish at the same spot, or go to the other one.

Thanks for reading.
This was CS50x wooooooooooooooooooooo!
